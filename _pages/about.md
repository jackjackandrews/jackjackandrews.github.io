<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a postgraduate research student in the <a href="http://eee.manchester.ac.uk" target="_blank">School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> at <a href="http://manchester.ac.uk" target="_blank">The University of Manchester</a>. My research is focussed on improving the reliability of modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based voltage source converters (VSC) in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. This will involve investigating the effect of different computation/communication architectures upon the performance, cost and reliability of the MMC.</p>
